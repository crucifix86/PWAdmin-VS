# External Libraries

This directory should contain the following external DLL files:

## GNET.dll
- Required by the pwAdmin client
- This is a Perfect World network protocol library
- Place the GNET.dll file in this directory before building

If you don't have GNET.dll, the project will not compile. This DLL is typically part of the Perfect World server/client SDK.
